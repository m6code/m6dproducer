						Comparing or finding differences between files
						On Windows you use fc filename1 filename2 on windows line that didn’t change are not show only changed lines shows
						On Mac or Linux use diff –u filename1 filename2 (-u stands for unified format which makes reading the output easier) lines without + or – sign haven’t changed i.e the existed in both the first version and the second file, line with – sign was removed, and lines with + sign were added

						Git log shows the history of commits
						Git diff compares different version of a files by commit id
						e.g git diff 7ueywi78374983749 f83729018kfjskrurksjf
						git log - - stat gives a log and statistics of which files has changed
						git config - -global color.ui auto to use diff colors

						Setting up git on windows
						Configuring colors in git
						Configuring default editor git

						Git init initializes the git repository
						Git status shows which files have changed
						Git add filename.ext to add a file
						Git diff - -staged compares staging area with commit1
						Git diff commit1 commit2 compares commit1 and commit2
						The staging area is the snapshot of the most recent commits till changes are added to it.
						The working directory contains files that are currently been worked on
						The repository cointains the staged files with their commit ids
						The working directory and staging area does not have id so to compare files recently changed you just use git diff compares working directory to staging area
						Use git diff - - staged to check if the staged files (added) are same are the files you want to commit.
						Use git reset - -hard to discard any changes in the working directory or staging area (when run you can’t get the changes made back

						Branches
						Branches are used when you want to create a completely new version of your app/file
						Git allows you to create labels for your commit, these labels are called branches
						The master is the name given to the main branch and every time you create a repo git creates a master branch for you. You can have experimental (exp) branch, language (lang) branch
						Use git checkout branchName to switch to a branch
						e.g git checkout exp to switch from the master to the experiment branch.
						It is possible to have several branch but the latest commit goes to the currently working branch. The latest branch commit is known as the branch id
						To combine two branches you use merge. The process of combining two commit is known as merge
						Use git branch to view available branches
						Use git branch exp-mode to create an exp-mode branch of the master branch.
						Use git checkout exp-mode to switch from the master to the exp-mode branch

						Configuring Defaults text editor for git
						git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Sublime Text 3/sublime_text.exe' -n -w"

						make a new branch for every new feature or bug fix if multiple people are working together on a project.
						To visualize branch structure
						Use git log - -graph branch1 branch2 to visualize the structure in multiple lines
						Use git log - -graph - -oneline branchname1 branchname2 to visualize the structure in one line
						You can checkout a commit with the commit id in detached HEAD state i.e git checkout 47uriwuyrhhfskkdoqi9489eu
						Changes made in the above are not saved to any branch
						On the checkout commit to save the changes you basically create and checkout a new branch by using this short cut instead of typing git branch new_branch and git checkout new_branch
						You just type this git checkout –b new_branch (The shortcut for it)
						Merging and Deleting a branch
						Use git merge branch1 branch2 to merge branch1 and 2 together
						Use git show to see what changes were introduced by a commit compared to its parent’s
						Use git branch –d branchName to delete a branch
						Use git log –n 2 to display only 2 commit logs

						Github
						Use git remote to view all the current remotes available
						Use git remote –v to give more information like the origin url
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">

						Creating a Github repo and uploading local files to the Repo
						i.	first create a repo on Github, donot initialize readme file
						ii.	use git - -version : to check the version of github installed
						iii.	use git config - -list : to see any configuration already setup
						iv.	use git config - -global user.name “Benjamin Sharia” : to setup user name
						v.	use git config - -global user.email “youremail@host.com”  : to setup user email
						vi.	after creating and moving the files to the directory you wish to work on, from command line move into the directory and type git init : to initialize the directory as a git repo
						vii.	use git add filename.ext : to add a particular file in the working directory
						viii.	or use git add . : to add all the files in the directory
						ix.	or use git add *.ext : to add a particular file extention to the repo
						x.	use git commit –m “Your commit message” : the git commit adds the files the –m message adds the commit message
						xi.	to push to the Github repo you created in the first step use  git remote add origin https://github.com/username/theRepo.git this create a connection pointing to the github repo.
						xii.	then you use git push origin master : to push your local repo to you github repo, enter your username and password for the github account
						If there is no error with the username or password your repo will be pushed to github successfully
